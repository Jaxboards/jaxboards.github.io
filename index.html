            JaxBoards has been built from the ground up: utilizing feedback from
            members and forum gurus along the way to create the world's first
            real-time, AJAX-powered forum - the first bulletin board software to
            utilize modern technology to make each user's experience as easy and
            as enjoyable as possible.
